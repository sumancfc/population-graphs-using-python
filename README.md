# Population Analysis Visualization Project

This project contains Python scripts for generating visualizations related to population data.  It includes code for creating both bar charts and population pyramids.

## Overview

The primary goal is to provide clear and informative visualizations of population demographics.  The visualizations are created using `matplotlib` in Python.

## Files

*   `bar.py`: Python script to generate a bar chart representing population distribution by age and gender.
*   `pyramid.py`: Python script to generate a population pyramid visualization.
*   `README.md`: This file, providing documentation for the project.

## Requirements

To run the scripts, you will need the following:

*   Python 3.x
*   `matplotlib` library
*   `numpy` library

You can install the necessary libraries using `pip`:
